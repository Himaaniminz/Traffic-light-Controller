# Traffic-Controller
Two-Way Traffic Light Controller
# Description
This project implements a Two-Way Traffic Light Controller using logic gates, flip-flops, and FSM (Finite State Machine) principles. The system efficiently manages traffic flow at an intersection with two opposing directions, ensuring safety and synchronization of signals.
# Features

* Two-Way Traffic Management with Red, Yellow, and Green lights.

* FSM-Based Logic for state transitions.
* Digital Circuit Implementation using logic gates and flip-flops.
* Clock and Timer Control for signal duration management.
* Scalable Design that can be expanded with sensors for real-time traffic adaptation.
